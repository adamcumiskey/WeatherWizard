# WeatherWizard

This project is an example of an app build using the [Swift Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

Before reading through the code, you should probably watch [this](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep100-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-1) tutorial series in order to understand the design

## Installation
To run WeatherWizard, you will need an API key from OpenWeatherAPI.
Go to their [site](https://openweathermap.org/api) to register for an account and generate an api key.

Once you have an API key, set the `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable for both `WeatherWizardiOS` and `WeatherWizardMacOS`.
